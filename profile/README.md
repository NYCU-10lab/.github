## Computational Structural Biology
With the assistance of computer science, we are exploring the world by studying the structure and function of biological molecules like proteins and DNA. Our lab is devoted to developing algorithms and computational systems applicable to protein structure prediction, drug design, protein engineering, biofuel production, and environmental protection. Several state-of-the-art web services and novel databases of computational biology have marked us a creative and energetic digital lab.

## Medical Science & Health Care
We are interested in computer-aided drug design and have focus our energy on the development of antibody-based drugs for cancers and metabolic syndrome. Dr. Lo, the chief of our lab, has been teaching metabolism and health care for years. Some of his lectures and teaching materials that may be good references for health self-management are available at [this page](http://10.life.nctu.edu.tw/index.php?p=researches&c=med).

## Ecology & Environmental Protection
The lifelong cause of Dr. Lo is ecological conservation and environmental protection. Hence, the ultimate goal of the 10Lab is to condense our knowledge and scientific, industrial, and financial resources on species recovery and environment protection. In the near future, several collaborating biotech companies will help us establish a fund for our cause. Dr. Lo has been teaching ecology and environmental protection for years, some valuable pictures of endangered species and his teaching materials can be found [here](http://10.life.nctu.edu.tw/index.php?p=researches&c=eco).
